# SSH

In this project, I became familiar with connecting to and working
with servers using the SSH protocol. I worked on a server
provided by ALX School.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Use a private key**
  * [0-use_a_private_key](./0-use_a_private_key): Bash script that uses `ssh` to connect to my
Holberton-provided server.

* **1. Create an SSH key pair**
  * [1-create_ssh_key_pair](./1-create_ssh_key_pair): Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

* **2. Client configuration file**
  * [2-ssh_config](./2-ssh_config): SSH configuration file configured to use the private key
`~/.ssh/school` and to refuse authentication using a password.

*  **4. Client configuration file (w/ Puppet)**
   [100-puppet_ssh_config.pp](./100-puppet_ssh_config.pp): Puppet file for making changes to our configuration file. Just as in the   
   previous configuration file task, weâ€™d like you to set up your client's SSH configuration file so that you can connect to a server 
   without typing a password.

   Requirements:
   
   Your SSH client configuration must be configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/school
   Your SSH client configuration must be configured to refuse to authenticate using a password
