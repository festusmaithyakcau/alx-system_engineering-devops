# Processes and signals

In this project, I learned about handling process ID's and signals in Bash

with `ps`, `pgrep`, `pkill`, `pkill`, `exit`, and `trap`.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. What is my PID**

  * [0-what-is-my-pid](./0-what-is-my-pid): Bash script that displays its own PID.

* **1. List your processes**

  * [1-list_your_processes](./1-list_your_processes): Bash script that displays a

  list of currently running processes.

  * Shows all processes for all users, including those not featuring a TTY.

  * Processes are displayed in a user-oriented hierarchy.

* **2. Show your Bash PID**

  * [2-show_your_bash_pid](./2-show_your_bash_pid): Bash script that displays lines

  containing the `bash` keyword based on the script defined in `1-list_your_processes`.

* **3. Show your Bash PID made easy**

  * [3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy](./3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy): Bash script

  that displays the PID along with the process name of processes who name contains the

  word `bash`.
  
* **4. To infinity and beyond**

  * [4-to_infinity_and_beyond](./4-to_infinity_and_beyond): Bash script that displays

  `To infinity and beyond` indefinitely with a `sleep 2` in between each iteration.
