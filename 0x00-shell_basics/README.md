# Shell -> basics

In this project, I underwent an introductory crash course in the Shell. I
learned how to navigate directories using `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`, how to look
around using `ls`, `less`, and `file`, and how to manipulate files with `cp`,
`mv`, `rm`, and `mkdir`. Further, I practiced working with the `type`, `which`,
`help`, and `man` commands, implementing wildcards, reading man pages,
creating links, and using keyboard shortcuts in Bash.
